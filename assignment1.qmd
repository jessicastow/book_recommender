## Objectives

The objectives of this report were as follows:

1\. Build recommender systems that predict the rating a user will give to a book based on each of:

a\) item-based collaborative filtering,

b\) user-based collaborative filtering, and

c\) matrix factorisation.

2\. Assessment and ensemble model:

a\) Assess the accuracy of the matrix factorisation recommender system, using a single train/test sample.

b\) Assess the accuracy of the matrix factorisation recommender system with and without regularisation.

c\) Create a final model that ensembles the predictions from the three approaches, and then assess the accuracy of the ensemble predictions.
