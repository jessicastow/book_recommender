# Objectives

The objectives of this report were as follows:

1\. Build recommender systems that predict the rating a user will give to a book based on each of:

a\) item-based collaborative filtering,

b\) user-based collaborative filtering, and

c\) matrix factorisation.

2\. Assessment and ensemble model:

a\) Assess the accuracy of the matrix factorisation recommender system, using a single train/test sample.

b\) Assess the accuracy of the matrix factorisation recommender system with and without regularisation.

c\) Create a final model that ensembles the predictions from the three approaches, and then assess the accuracy of the ensemble predictions.

# Introduction to Data Mining and Recommender Systems

Recommender systems utilise data mining techniques to offer personalised suggestions by analysing patterns in user preferences and behaviours (Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, 2012). The collaborative filtering approach specifically focuses on identifying users with similar tastes or preferences, recommending items based on the opinions and actions of those with shared interests. This method may also take into account a user’s social environment to enhance the relevance of the recommendations.

## User-Based Collaborative Filtering

In order to take a user's interests into account is to identify users that are similar to them, and suggest the things that those users are interested in (Grus, 2015).

To get an idea of how similar two users are we need to use the *cosine similarity* metric, which states the following:

Given two vectors, $\boldsymbol x$ and $\boldsymbol y$:

$$cos(\theta) = \frac{\boldsymbol x \cdot \boldsymbol y}{||\boldsymbol x|| \ ||\boldsymbol y||} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x^2_i} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y^2_i}}$$

Cosine similarity ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater similarity. As two vectors become more aligned, the angle between them decreases, and the cosine similarity approaches 1, reflecting highly similar user preferences. Conversely, a larger angle results in a cosine similarity closer to 0, indicating that the preferences are very different.
